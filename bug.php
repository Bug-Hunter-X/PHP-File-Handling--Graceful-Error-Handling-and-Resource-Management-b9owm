```php
$file = fopen("myfile.txt", "r+");
if ($file) {
    // ... process the file ...
    fclose($file);
}
```
This code has a potential flaw. If `fopen()` fails (e.g., the file doesn't exist or is not readable), `$file` will be `false`.  The subsequent `fclose($file)` will then attempt to close a `false` value, resulting in a warning.  This might not cause immediate errors, but it's bad practice and can mask other potential issues.

Another subtle problem can arise when dealing with file pointers directly. PHP's file handling functions, while convenient, can sometimes be finicky with resource management.  Failure to properly close resources can lead to resource leaks.
