# PHP File Handling: Graceful Error Handling and Resource Management

This repository demonstrates a common issue in PHP file handling:  failing to handle potential errors from `fopen()` and potential resource leaks.  The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a robust solution.

**Problem:** The original code lacks proper error handling when `fopen()` fails. It also demonstrates a potential resource leak if file operations are not properly managed.

**Solution:** The solution introduces improved error checking using `fopen()`'s return value and a more robust way to handle file operations to prevent resource leaks.
